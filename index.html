        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Anna, I'm a new-ish web developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly websites. 
            I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you through this portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for web development began in my teens (early 2000s), Blogging was just becoming a thing and I taught myself 
            basic HTML and CSS as well as basic graphic design skills to level up my blog through dynamic layouts and custom graphics. 
            Unfortunately, life got in the way and I had to put my pursuit of web development on hold for a while.
            Now, I'm back and more determined than ever to pursue my passion as a career.
